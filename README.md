# aoc2025
Advent of code 2025

Totally ready for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) 2025!<br>
This year, I'll continue compulsory. 🎄😎<br>

### How to run
You need to provide your own puzzle inputs. Aoc doesn't allow sharing of one's own input.<br>
Create a DayX.txt file for each day at the root of the project.

- Run from command line: dotnet run
- Run from your favorite dotnet core IDE

## Day 0
<img src="Day0.png" alt="Day 0 - *Image generated by Nano Banana*" width="400"/><br>
Getting ready, decided to use Nano Banana this time to generate me some images.<br>

## Day 1
<img src="Day1.png" alt="Day 1 - *Image generated by Nano Banana*" width="400"/><br>
Traditionally, this one was easy, but part 2 was harder than expected 😅

## Day 2
<img src="Day2.png" alt="Day 1 - *Image generated by Nano Banana*" width="400"/><br>
Nice property usage of SumOfN for part 1, (fast) NrOfDigits from previous year Day 11 comes in handy 😃

### Timings and memory usage
| Day    | Time (ms) | Memory (MB) |
|-------:|----------:|------------:|
| Day 2  | 8.0       | 0.0         |
| Day 1  | 2.6       | 0.3         |
|*Total* | *10.6*    | *0.3*       |
